## Overview

Resume Analyser 2.0 is a web application built with Flask that allows users to upload a resume (in e.g. PDF or DOCX format) and gets it analysed to extract key information, score it or provide suggestions (customise this section with your exact functionality). The app is hosted via the Hugging Face Spaces platform at the link above.

## Features

* Upload a resume file (PDF, DOCX, etc)
* Extract personal details, skills, experience summary (adjust according to what your analyzer does)
* Automated scoring or rating of resume (if applicable)
* Provide feedback or suggestions for improving the resume (if applicable)
* Simple and responsive web UI built using Flask

## Tech Stack

* **Backend**: Flask (Python)
* **Frontend**: HTML / CSS / JS (or if you used any framework mention here)
* **Hosting / Deployment**: Hugging Face Spaces
* **Others**: Any libraries you used (e.g., `pdfplumber`, `docx`, `Spacy`, `pandas`, etc) — list them
